# districtconversion
districtconversion provides a script to convert regional data from one administrative division to another. The data are converted proportionally to the area overlap between each district of the two divisions. Such conversions can be useful when working with geodata collected in historical administrative divisions. Often the data need to be aligned with a more recent administrative divison, requiring a conversion. For an example, see the file example_taxdistricts_to_landkreise_1926_1938.py. 

The script originiates from work on regional tax data from the German interwar period that are available in the Harvard Dataverse: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/MIE4XB
